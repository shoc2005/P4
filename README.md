# SmartCab agent simulation by using Q-learning algorithm

This project demonstrates how Cab agent will learn from the previous experience and
learn driving rules ONLY from rewards of their actions.

## Requirements

1) Python 2.7
2) PyGame

## Run parameters

In the python script file agent.py in the run method, you can set different parameters:
1) n_trials=100 (how many trials to use for learning and acting)
2) display=True (display or not the agent environment graphically)
3) update_delay=0.001 (delay in seconds while updating agent's state)

## Run
python agent.py
